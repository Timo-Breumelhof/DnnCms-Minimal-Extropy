# Dnn-Cms Minimal-Extropy
I think it must have been at least 10 year when I created the Minimal Extropy skin for #dnncms (for DNN 5).
I had not expected that some users would still be using the Minimal Extropy skin on DNN9, but apparently they do.

** Please note that I would strongly advise you not to use this skin any more as it's not HTML5, not responsive and partly uses Tables for layout.

I'm only providing this so the skin works in DNN9, but don't expect anything else. :-)
The first release will be the orginal skin itself.
