# Dnn-Cms Minimal-Extropy
I think it must have been at least 10 year when I created the Minimal Extropy skin for #dnncms (for DNN 5).
I had not expected that some users would still be using the Minimal Extropy skin on DNN9, but apparently they do.

## Please note that I would strongly advise you NOT to use this skin any more.
## It's not in HTML5, not responsive and partly uses Tables for layout.

I'm only providing this so the skin works in DNN9, but don't expect anything else. :-)
The first release will be the orginal skin itself.
